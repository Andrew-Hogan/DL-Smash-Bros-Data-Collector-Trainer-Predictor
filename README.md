# DL-Smash-Bros-Data-Collector-Trainer-Predictor
Python files for collecting data and then playing.


The keyboard data collector records a pre-determined region of the screen along with keyboard presses upon unique keyboard events relevant to playing smash bros with my control setup.


The modelnew trains a neural network based on data imported from the keyboard data collector.

Smashed will send controls to a smash bros emulator in order to evaluate test time performance.
